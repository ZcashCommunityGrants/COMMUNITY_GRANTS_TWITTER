## Notes

- Only newly created files are handled, deletions, updates or renames are ignored.
- `*.tweet` files will not be created for tweets you send out directly from twitter.com
- If you need to rename an existing tweet file, please do so locally using [`git mv old_filename new_filename`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/renaming-a-file-using-the-command-line), otherwise it may occur as deleted and added which would trigger a new tweet.
- your message must fit into a single tweet
